I am a self-driven technology enthusiast that enjoys working on big impact, ground breaking projects.  Having been developing software since I was eight years old I've worked across a wide breadth of industries, languages and virtually the entire gamut of technology stacks.  My most recent area of expertise has been in developing Internet of Things solutions including the embedded programming of custom hardware to the back-end cloud services to support them including machine trained AI models, business intelligence and client user interfaces.
